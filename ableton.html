        <pre>We make <a href="#live">Live</a>, <a href="#push">Push</a>, <a href="#note">Note</a> and <a href="#link">Link</a> — unique software and <br>hardware for music creation and performance. With these <br>products, our community of users creates amazing things.</pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a<br> community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.</pre>

        <pre>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But <br>when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <pre>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion <br>for what we make, and the people we make it for.</pre>

    <div><pre>Why Ableton - Juanpe Bolivar</pre></div>
    <div class="boldBody"><pre>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided <br>between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles <br>and Tokyo.</pre></div>
    <div><pre>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We <br>come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are <br>self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each <bre>of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music <br>culture.</pre></div>
    <img src="" alt="Image not available.">
    <div class="boldBody"><pre>We believe it takes focus to create truly outstanding instruments. <br>We only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.</pre></div>
    <div><pre>Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their <br>magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly <br>diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree <br>with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.</pre></div>
    <img src="graphs.png" alt="Image not available.">
    <div class="boldBody"><pre>We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re equally passionate <br>about improving who we are.</pre></div>
    <div><pre>We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally, <br>and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn from and with each other.<br><br>Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge <br>and skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development <br>and music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.</pre></div>
    <img src="" alt="Image not available.">
    <div class="boldBody"><pre>We want our employees to love it here. Since we’re looking for <br>exceptional talent from around the world, we will do everything we <br>can to make your transition as easy as possible.</pre></div>
    <div><pre>If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free <br>German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health <br>insurance for you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are <br>flexible, but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as <br>a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
    </pre></div>

    <img src="" alt="Image not available.">
    <pre>We’re really proud of the work<br> we’ve done so far. But there’s so <br>much more to come. If you’d like <br>to be a part of it, please join us.<br></pre>
